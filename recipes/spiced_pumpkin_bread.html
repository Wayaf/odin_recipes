		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>A pumpkin loaf spiced with cinnamon, ground cloves, and nutmeg. 
			I came up with this recipe after many 
			failed attempts at pumpkin loaf. <br>
			I adapted a favorite banana loaf recipe and this was the result. 
			Yum! This recipe yields 3 loaves. 
			Stock your freezer!</p>
